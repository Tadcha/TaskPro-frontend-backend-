# Docker Security Notes

## Vulnerability Warnings

This project uses standard Docker Hub base images (`node:20-alpine`, `nginx:stable-alpine`) which may contain known vulnerabilities. These warnings are common and expected for demo/portfolio projects.

### Current Status

- **Node.js Build Stage**: 1 high vulnerability detected
- **Nginx Production Stage**: 2 critical, 2 high vulnerabilities detected

### Production Recommendations

For production deployments, implement these security practices:

1. **Use Organization-Approved Base Images**

   ```dockerfile
   # Instead of public images, use approved internal registry
   FROM internal-registry.company.com/node:20-alpine-secure
   FROM internal-registry.company.com/nginx:stable-alpine-patched
   ```

2. **Implement Vulnerability Scanning**

   ```bash
   # Regular scanning with tools like:
   docker scout quickview
   trivy image taskpro-frontend
   snyk container test taskpro-frontend
   ```

3. **Use Distroless Images** (for reduced attack surface)

   ```dockerfile
   FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:20
   FROM gcr.io/distroless/static
   ```

4. **Multi-Stage Security**

   - Build dependencies in separate stage
   - Copy only runtime artifacts to production stage
   - Use non-root users (already implemented)

5. **Regular Updates**
   - Automated base image updates
   - Security patch management
   - CI/CD vulnerability gates

## Current Security Measures

✅ **Multi-stage builds** - Reduces final image size
✅ **Non-root user** - Runs as `taskpro` user
✅ **Package updates** - `apk update && apk upgrade`
✅ **Minimal packages** - Only installs necessary tools
✅ **Cache cleanup** - Removes package cache

## Portfolio Context

This Dockerfile demonstrates best practices for:

- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Security-conscious configuration
- Production-ready patterns
- Documentation of security considerations

The vulnerability warnings shown are from the base images and are acknowledged with appropriate mitigation strategies documented.
